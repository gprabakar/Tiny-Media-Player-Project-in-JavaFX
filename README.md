The media player project consists of three files MediaPlayer.java, MediaPlayer.fxml and MediaPlayerController.java. 
Here MediaPlayer.java is the main file.

The media player project's main file MediaPlayer.java that loads the Graphical User Interface with all the necessary control buttons and 
the title Media Player Application. The File Menu with the Open Menu Item opens our desired mp4 media file and plays the video. 
The control buttons like Play, Pause, Stop and etc do the jobs accordingly.

The file MediaPlayerController.java actually controls everything in the Media Player. The basic actions are performed with all the necessary 
methods like openVideo(), playVideo(), pauseVideo(), fastVideo(), and slowVideo() etc.

The MediaPlayer.fxml consists of syntax like HTML. This code is automatically generated once you complete the GUI using the Scene Builder.
